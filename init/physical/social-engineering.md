# Social Engineering (WIP)

init: Caprico

Social engineering is a practice that can be simplified down to "Getting another person to do something they should not do for you"

Some people have multiple tools to aid in social engineering but I'll just give what I've had work for now.


### Definitions:

* Pretext: Whatever your 'character' or 'scenario' you are trying to convey during the engagment.
* Request to Exit Sensor: A fire code required device installed above doors to unlock in case of power outage or a detected person.

# 1. Metal Clipboard

For $20, you can already give yourself a leg up on physical engagements. At least if your pretext supports it.

## 1.1 California Smalls

On one assessment I was tasked with infiltrating a company's office building in the middle of downtown L.A. This would usually be a walk in the park but...this was a tiny office in a very large office building. So to get into the place before hand I stepped to the side of the doors to lobby and waited till I saw a person that looked to be a office worker or had their hands full walk into the building. 

A lady carrying six shopping bags walks past me. Perfect. Hold the door for them. Get the elevator for them. And then get to the floor. (luckily they were going to the same floor). She did ask what I did. I said "I work for a contracting company for the building management" I show the clipboard and a fake badge I'd made and no more questions were asked. Power of the clipboard 1, people questioning/reporting 0.

I then get to the floor and then try to find this tiny office. I then wait outside and check to see if it is locked. I just barely get the handle a 1/8th of the way turned and then a employee walks right out almost crashing into me. They looked at my clipboard and said "excuse me" and kept walking. I then set myself up in the office and explained that I was an electrician and we needed to test some things for the building management. Clipboard get's looked at, I'm free to do whatever. I plug in a USB rubber ducky and boom. 20 people in an office smaller than some apartments I've rented and I've pwned it. 

Albeit the clipboard didn't bring up a statement of "Oh you have a clipboard, you must be here to fix something important", the reaction that you get from people that see a more believable representation of the person that you are saying you are is the kicker. If I walked in with antenna's and a band t-shirt they may have been more suspicious. 

This is just one example of a tool (inexpensive at that) that will get you very far into an engagment just by its mere presence.

## 1.2 Hide the loot/tool

One of the great things about these as well is that you can hide your tools in it as well.

I've hidden:

* Lockpicks
* Shove knifes
* Raspi's
* Letter of Authorization
* Plastic Shims
* Sensitive documents I took from a desk
* Badges

all inside the clipboard. If you don't have a lot of space inside of a bag or your outfit I highly recommend that you add this to your equipment as it's an unassuming storage device.
